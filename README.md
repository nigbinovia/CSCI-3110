# CSCI-3110
This repository includes all the assignments I completed in CSCI 3110 - Algorithms and Data Structures.

The following directories include:

project 1 - This program implments the preparation routines used in a card game played
among four players. The inputs include a CardType Struct, a CardClass class, a count and
cardType array data members, 4 enum variables, and a few functions to shuffle,
deal, sort and print the cards. The outputs include 4 hands for 4 players organized by suit printed, and if the 2 of clubs is found, a message stating such is printed too.

project 2 - This program uses a Card, Deck, and Player class to build an interactive card game between the user and the computer. There are 26 rounds and whoever's card has the higher point value wins the round.

project 3 - This program creates a flight map of cities based on a data file of ciites provided. The cities are stored and sorted in a vector. A build function is then used to collect every origin city that can be linked to a valid destination city and creates a list connecting each origin city to every destination city it has. Then, all this data is printed with the flight numbers and prices.

project 4 - TBC

project 5 - This C++ program reads user and seller data from files, creating objects for each seller type. After user authentication, the program offers actions such as printing all seller data, checking specific sellers, adding new sellers (regular and power), and removing sellers. It provides a console interface to manage and interact with seller and user information.
