# CSCI-3110
This repository includes all the assignments I completed in CSCI 3110 - Algorithms and Data Structures.

The following directories include:
project 1 - This program implments the preparation routines used in a card game played
among four players. The inputs include a CardType Struct, a CardClass class, a count and
cardType array data members, 4 enum variables, and a few functions to shuffle,
deal, sort and print the cards. The outputs include 4 hands for 4 players organized by suit printed, and if the 2 of clubs is found, a message stating such is printed too.

project 2 - This program uses a Card, Deck, and Player class to build an interactive card game between the user and the computer. There are 26 rounds and whoever's card has the higher point value wins the round.
